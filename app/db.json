Dom Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) doesn't steal things, he steals ideas. By projecting himself deep into the subconscious of his targets, he can glean information that even the best computer hackers can't get to. In the world of corporate espionage, Cobb is the ultimate weapon. But even weapons have their weakness, and when Cobb loses everything, he's forced to embark on one final mission in a desperate quest for redemption. This time, Cobb won't be harvesting an idea, but sowing one. Should he and his team of specialists succeed, they will have discovered a new frontier in the art of psychic espionage. They've planned everything to perfection, and they have all the tools to get the job done. Their mission is complicated, however, by the sudden appearance of a malevolent foe that seems to know exactly what they're up to, and precisely how to stop them. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","posters":{"thumbnail":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166725_tmb.jpg","profile":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166725_tmb.jpg","detailed":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166725_tmb.jpg","original":"http://content7.flixster.com/movie/11/16/67/11166725_tmb.jpg"},"abridged_cast":[{"name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","id":"162659161","characters":["Cobb"]},{"name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","id":"162666960","characters":["Arthur"]},{"name":"Ellen Page","id":"326392013","characters":["Ariadne"]},{"name":"Tom Hardy","id":"391527059","characters":["Eames"]},{"name":"Ken Watanabe","id":"335718197","characters":["Saito"]}],"abridged_directors":[{"name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"studio":"Warner Bros.

Diesel reprises his role as the antihero Riddick, a dangerous, escaped convict wanted by every bounty hunter in the known galaxy. The infamous Riddick has been left for dead on a sun-scorched planet that appears to be lifeless. Soon, however, he finds himself fighting for survival against alien predators more lethal than any human he's encountered. The only way off is for Riddick to activate an emergency beacon and alert mercenaries who rapidly descend to the planet in search of their bounty. The first ship to arrive carries a new breed of merc, more lethal and violent, while the second is captained by a man whose pursuit of Riddick is more personal. With time running out and a storm on the horizon that no one could survive, his hunters won't leave the planet without Riddick's head as their trophy.
